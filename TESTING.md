## üéØ Performance Benchmarks

Expected response times (on development environment):
- Health check: < 50ms
- Get tickets (paginated): < 200ms
- Dashboard metrics: < 500ms
- Create ticket: < 300ms
- Complex queries with filters: < 800ms

## üîß Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "user-id header required"
**Solution**: Always include the `user-id` header in requests:
```bash
-H "user-id: admin"
```

### Issue: Database not initialized
**Solution**: Restart the server - it will auto-generate sample data

### Issue: Port already in use
**Solution**: Change PORT in .env file or kill process on port 3001

### Issue: Missing dependencies
**Solution**: Run `npm install` in both root and server directories
